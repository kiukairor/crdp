# Populate your Registration Token
A proper way to do this would be to fetch this reg token from a secrets manager (e.g. : CipherTrust Secrets Management)
For now, simply create a one liner file called 'value' containing the registration token fetched from CipherTrust Manager. 

See root README.md for more details on how to generate this Registration Token.
